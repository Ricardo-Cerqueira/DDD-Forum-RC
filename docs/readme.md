## General info

Each folder contains the work done in each sprint (A-G).
The documentation will be different because we improved our work in each passing sprint.
The main files/folders I recommend reading to help navigate through the sprint are:

- readme.md
- presentation

Be aware, this is only the documentation part of the project. There will be detailed information about what was done. However, to check the tests/implementations, you will have to navigate to other folders.
